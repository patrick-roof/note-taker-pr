# Note Taker

## Description
This application is a note taker that will save a user's input and display it on the screen and in file storage. It switches between two html files, index and notes. It was made using node js and express, and deployed with Heroku.

During this project I've learned a lot about express, GET/POST requests, file storage and node js.
